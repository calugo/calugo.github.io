Hello Everyone! and welcome to my humble corner of the digital world. My name is Carlos, I am a Cambridge U.K. based physicist, and in this site I post content related to my scientific interests and some fun things I ended up working on and I would like to share. Below, I list a few of the academic and professional positions I have hold so far. A detailed list can be found in my 
 <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0095-566X">ORCID</a> and <a href= "https://linkedin.com/in/carlos-a-lugo-velez">Linkedin</a> profiles. 
</div>

* I got my degree from [UNAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico) in [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City), working on stochastic models of city-size distributions in space and time. 

* I got my  PhD from the University of Manchester in the U.K. under the supervision of Prof. Alan J. McKane. There, I worked on evolution of food-web structures and stochastic population dynamics in space and time.

* Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) Applied Physics Department, working with Prof. Blas Echeberria. During this post, I worked on detailed mathematical models and numerical simulations of calcium cycling in human atrial cells and the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.

* Centro de Astrobiología, CSIC-INTA (Madrid, Spain). As part Prof. Susanna Manrubia’s research group I carried out research related to the topology induced in the space of phenotypes by genotype-phenotype mappings for the case of RNA molecules.
    
* University of Cambridge - Department of Plant Sciences (Cambridge U.K). As part of Prof. Beverley Glover's Evolution and Development group, I worked on the mechanical origins of petal epidermal cells patterns. 

* University of Cambridge - Sainsbury Laboratory (Cambridge U.K.). Here working with Francois Nèdelec, I carried out investigations of the dynamical origins of order-disorder transitions in the organization of the filaments composing the plant cortex.

In all these posts, my duties consist of finding the mechanisms underlying a certain phenomena, this is carried out by the application of the scientific method to postulate a set of hypothesis, abstract these hypothesis into mathematical models, then solve the models and study the solutions to make predictions.

I have also carried out work on Bioinformatics at TSL in Norwich U.K. and as a scientific programmer at The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge. In my spare time I work on robots, data visualisation, computer vision, AI and automation.
