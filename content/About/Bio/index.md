Hello and welcome! My name is Carlos, I am a theoretical physicist interested in the application of physics, mathematics, data and computers to the study and solution of problems arising in the area of complex systems. I create mathematical and physical models to describe how systems composed by many interacting elements evolve in time and space. I also numerically solve models to better understand how a system works, e.g. making predictions and forecasting all the possible scenarios which a system can undergo, or predicting a system's response to perturbations, treatments and interventions. 

I have applied my expertise in many areas, including research into the formation and evolution of ecosystems, molecular evolution, the origin of cardiac arrhythmias in the human heart, pattern development in petals and chemo-mechanics of the plant cell cortex.

The tools I employ can be broadly classified in two categories, <b>Numerical</b> and <b>Theoretical</b>. 

The theoretical approaches include applications of the theory of <b>dynamical systems</b> and <b>non-linear dynamics</b>, <b>chemical kinetics</b>, <b>game theory</b>, <b>mechanics and elasticity</b> , <b>population genetics</b> and <b>population dynamics</b>, the theory of <b>excitable systems</b>  and <b>complex networks</b> as useful conceptual frameworks. I often use  <b>statistical learning</b> and <b>inference</b> to quantify the results.

The numerical aspect involves the solution of the equations for the simulations of the systems under study, which might consist of the development of optimization schemes used in the  <b>finite element method</b> for solving PDEs, <b>explicit</b> and <b>implicit</b> schemes to solve ODEs, or <b>Monte-Carlo</b> methods for stochastic simulations. All these techniques require development and deployment in a computer. 

I also have a very strong interest in <b>data visualization</b>, <b>data analysis</b>, <b>interactive simulations</b>, and <b>automation</b> of physical computing devices and sensors for data collection, outreach demonstrations and experiments. Basically, every now and then I build robots and machines to do something fun, and at a very very very <b>low cost</b> .

Many of the projects I have worked on are described here, the codes and detailed instructions are archived and documented in my  <a href="https://github.com/calugo">github</a> , <a href= "https://gitlab.com/calugo">gitlab</a>  and  <a href= "https://www.hackster.io/kupkasmale">Hackster</a> pages.
