Hello and welcome! My name is Carlos, I am a theoretical physicist interested in the application of physics, mathematics and computers to 
the study and solution of problems arising in the area of complex systems. By combining  data, mathematics, physics we can write down mathematical and physical models to describe how systems composed by many interacting elements evolve in time and space. To understand how a system works, make predictions and forecast all the possible scenarios which a system can undergo, as well as the response to perturbations, treatments and interventions, we often require to numerically solve the models. These are two of my areas of expertise.

I have carried out research in the formation and evolution of ecosystems, molecular evolution, the origin of cardiac arrhythmias in the human heart, pattern development in petals and chemo-mechanics of the plant cell cortex, to mention some.

The tools employed in such works can be broadly classified in two categories, <b>Numerical</b> and <b>Theoretical</b>. 

The theoretical approaches include applications of the theory of <b>dynamical systems</b> and <b>non-linear dynamics</b>, <b>chemical kinetics</b>, <b>game theory</b>, <b>mechanics and elasticity</b> , <b>population genetics</b> and <b>population dynamics</b>, the theory of <b>excitable systems</b>  and <b>complex networks</b> as useful conceptual frameworks. And  <b>statistical learning</b> and <b>inference</b> to quantify the results.

The numerical aspect involves the solution of the equations involved in the simulations of the systems under study, which might consist of the development of optimizations schemes used in the  <b>finite element method</b> for solving PDEs, <b>explicit</b> and <b>implicit</b> schemes to solve ODEs, <b>Monte-Carlo</b> methods for stochastic simulations. All these techniques, require the development and deployment of such schemes in a computer. 

Alongside the above two categories, I have developed a very strong interest in <b>data visualization</b>, <b>data analysis</b>, <b>interactive simulations</b>, and <b>automation</b> of physical computing devices and sensors for data collection, outreach demonstrations and experiments. Basically, every now and then I build robots and machines to do something fun, and at a very very very <b>low cost</b> .

Many of the projects I have worked in are described here, the codes and detailed instructions are archived and documented in my  <a href="https://github.com/calugo">github</a> , <a href= "https://gitlab.com/calugo">gitlab</a>  and  <a href= "https://www.hackster.io/kupkasmale">Hackster</a> pages.
