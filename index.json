Here, I showcase ways to visualise complex networks with some degree of interactivity.\nThese little renderings were conceived for lectures, talks and videos and rarely make their way into an academic publication, despite their didactic value. The reason is very simple, publications are a two dimensional, almost static version of media. However, technologies such as Jupyter, WebGL and other rendering backend libraries have been available for a long time now, and their corresponding api\u0026rsquo;s made very easy to use for everybody.\nFor the sake of brevity, let's cut to the case, here I am going through how and why I made renderings such as the ones below and what exactly these represent. Viewer I. # The genetic code mutation network, which is the example used for this post. It should work on most devices, but for a full session of fun, try it with a mouse on a separate tab. The recommended way to play with the viewer, is on single window, which can be accessed here and a legacy version with draggable nodes here\nWhat is this network? : The genetic code. # For theoreticians, molecular evolution is often a problem to become familiar with stochastic processes, as mutation and recombination of sequences which generate new genetic variants in DNA and RNA are probabilistic. On its simplest form at least, the theory is also the prefect segway to understand the origin of important features present in living systems, such as the concepts of robustness of phenotypes to perturbations of the genotype as well as evolvability or the origin of the great variability observed in the phenotypes.\nThese evolutionary features are also somewhat universal, and these are observed in systems of very different scale and nature, such as molecules, gene-regulation circuits and networks and metabolic networks.\nBoth, robustness and evolvability are linked to the topology of the neutral genotype networks, which are defined by all the possible genotypes as nodes and linked if these are a mutation away.\nTake for instance the following table containing the genetic code:\nGenetic code Phe UUU Ser UCU Tyr UAU Cys UGU Phe UUC Ser UCC Tyr UAC Cys UGC Leu UUA Ser UCA Stp UAA Stp UGA Leu UUG Ser UCG Stp UAG Trp UGG Leu CUU Pro CCU His CAU Arg CGU Leu CUC Pro CCC His CAC Arg CGC Leu CUA Pro CCA Gln CAA Arg CGA Leu CUG Pro CCG Gln CAG Arg CGG Ile AUU Thr ACU Asn AAU Ser AGU Ile AUC Thr ACC Asn AAC Ser AGC Ile AUA Thr ACA Lys AAA Arg AGA Met AUG Thr ACG Lys AAG Arg AGG Val GUU Ala GCU Asp GAU Gly GGU Val GUC Ala GCC Asp GAC Gly GGC Val GUA Ala GCA Glu GAA Gly GGA Val GUG Ala GCG Glu GAG Gly GGG Each cell contains, on the left, the aminoacid (phenotype) associated with the codon sequence (genotype) on the right. In general for an alphabet of four characters like \\( \\{U,G,A,C\\} \\) there are \\( 4^L \\) unique sequences of length \\( L \\). Each one with \\( 3 L\\) neighbour sequences one character away from it. Using this and grouping the codons by aminoacid we get the following plot.\nThe genetic code network. Click me. Although (to my taste) the graph is very pretty, it is very difficult to get any any useful information easily. However if we remove all the links from one phenotype to another, keeping just the mutation links within the same aminoacid (synonymous mutations) it is immediate to see what it is meant by robustness, as all cases with more than a single codon, posses mutations which leave the phenotype unchanged. The genetic code network II - Synonymous components. Click me. Now, the most important bit. Evolvability and how is it reflected in these diagrams. By choosing an aminoacid and plotting only the links from its nodes to the rest of the system, we can see how easy is to navigate the network from one aminoacid to all the other ones by only a few mutations, specially for those phenotypes with the largest number of codons.\nAlanine, Arginine and Asparagine networks. Click on them! Aspartic acid, Cysteine and Glutamine networks. Click on them! Glutamine acid, Glycine and Histidine networks. Click on them! Isoleucine, Leucine and Lysine networks. Click on them! Methionine, Penylalanine and Proline networks. Click on them! Serine, Stop and Threonine networks. Click on them! Tryptophan, Tyrosin and Valine networks. Click on them! As we can see from these awesome plots (to my taste) even this simple system contains enough complexity to make the graphical representation of the main ideas quite convoluted. For comparison purposes and fun, all the information so far presented is shown in the same form in the viewer already presented at the beginning of this entry, and also, in the same format as the plots above, in the following renderer.\nViewer II. # The genetic code mutation network and its components. This should work on most devices, but for a full session of fun, try it with a mouse on a separate tab. (Link here!) Final comments. # The properties of resultant graph or phenotype landscape allow us to treat the problem of evolution as problem of navigating in a complex network. This is a problem suitable to be treated with tools of statistical physics. If we posses the knowledge of a well defined genotype-phenotype mapping. This is of course a condition not easily satisfied in the vast majority of real systems. However, the theoretical framework is fairly universal. As an example of this, the plot below shows the case of of the connections between two secondary structures for the case of RNA sequences of length 12. For relatively short lengths, the secondary structure can be considered as a good approximation or proxy for the genotype-phenotype mapping. Detail of the connections between two RNA secondary structures of length 12. Showing all the sequences which fold into such structures and connected to other sequences if these are one mutation away. Again, we can see that it is possible to mutate inside and outside the secondary structures, the folding temperature for this structures is T=27 C. Finally, these are links for the repository containing the code, as well as for the viewers.\nGithub repository.\nViewer I.\nViewer II.\nLegacy viewer with draggable nodes.\n","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-genetic-code-network/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Interactive network visualisation - The Genetic Code","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/molecular-evolution/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Molecular Evolution","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/networks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Networks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/threejs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Three,js","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/two.js/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Two.js","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/about-me/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/barcelona/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Barcelona","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cambridge/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cambridge","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/experience/","section":"Experiences","summary":"","title":"Experiences","type":"experience"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/madrid/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Madrid","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/physics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Physics","type":"tags"},{"content":" Hello Everyone! and welcome to my humble corner of the digital world. My name is Carlos, I am a Cambridge U.K. based physicist, and in this site I post content related to my scientific interests and some fun things I ended up working on and I would like to share. Below, I list a few of the academic and professional positions I have hold so far. A detailed list can be found in my ORCID and Linkedin profiles.\nI got my degree from UNAM in Mexico City, working on stochastic models of city-size distributions in space and time.\nI got my PhD from the University of Manchester in the U.K. under the supervision of Prof. Alan J. McKane. There, I worked on evolution of food-web structures and stochastic population dynamics in space and time.\nUniversitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) Applied Physics Department, working with Prof. Blas Echeberria. During this post, I worked on detailed mathematical models and numerical simulations of calcium cycling in human atrial cells and the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.\nCentro de Astrobiología, CSIC-INTA (Madrid, Spain). As part Prof. Susanna Manrubia’s research group I carried out research related to the topology induced in the space of phenotypes by genotype-phenotype mappings for the case of RNA molecules.\nUniversity of Cambridge - Department of Plant Sciences (Cambridge U.K). As part of Prof. Beverley Glover\u0026rsquo;s Evolution and Development group, I worked on the mechanical origins of petal epidermal cells patterns.\nUniversity of Cambridge - Sainsbury Laboratory (Cambridge U.K.). Here working with Francois Nèdelec, I carried out investigations of the dynamical origins of order-disorder transitions in the organization of the filaments composing the plant cortex.\nIn all these posts, my duties consist of finding the mechanisms underlying a certain phenomena, this is carried out by the application of the scientific method to postulate a set of hypothesis, abstract these hypothesis into mathematical models, then solve the models and study the solutions to make predictions. I have also carried out work on Bioinformatics at TSL in Norwich U.K. and as a scientific programmer at The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge. In my spare time I work on robots, data visualisation, computer vision, AI and automation.\n","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/experience/resume/","section":"Experiences","summary":"","title":"Resume","type":"experience"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/work-experience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Work-Experience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
